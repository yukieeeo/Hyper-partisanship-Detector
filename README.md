# Hyperpartisanship-Detector
The uploaded jupyter notebook is the final report inclusing description and codes for the Georgetown University ANLY580 NLP course final project. 
This project used the titles of 60,000 articles to develop a hyperpartisanship detection model to evaluate whether an article 
has hyperpartisanship or not.
